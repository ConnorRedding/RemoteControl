# Handsfree Remote Control
For many of us, we take changing the channel or volume for granted, however, for many this is not a simple task. The difficulty shows itself when some disabled individuals, like those who experience some degree of paralysis of the arm or hand, attempt to use a standard remote control. The purpose of this project is to produce a Remote Control that can be controlled through an assistive device, like a tablet, in conjunction with a joystick or eye tracker.
## Techical Details
Utilizing an ESP32, the remote control hosts a web server through which a user has access to large, east to "click" buttons. When these buttons are "clicked", they issue a command which blinks an IR LED at a precise frequency that has already been matched with any given set-top box's remote sequencing.
